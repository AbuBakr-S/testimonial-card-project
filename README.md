## Tech Stack and Approach

Built with **Next.js 14 (App Router)**, **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **TypeScript**.

I approached the task by focusing on clean, accessible UI. Semantic HTML tags like `<figure>`, `<figcaption>`, and `<blockquote>` were used to reinforce meaning and structure. Styling was handled with Tailwind’s utility classes to ensure responsiveness across screen sizes. I used the `next/image` component for optimised image loading and imported the **Noto Sans** font via Next.js’s built-in Google Fonts integration.

## Useful Resources and Lessons Learnt

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) – for spacing, layout, and gradient utilities  
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com) – used to inspect font weights and spacing for accurate implementation  
- Learned how to apply `min-w-[375px]` to prevent layout collapse on smaller viewports  
- Gained better understanding of semantic HTML and accessibility-friendly markup
